<h1>Licensing</h1>

<p>By having any Visage Technologies Program, or part of it, installed or copied on your computer, you agree to the terms
of the <a href="../license.txt"><em>Visage Technologies AB Software License Agreement</em></a>. If you do not agree with these terms,
please entirely remove any Visage Technologies Programs from your computer.</br></br>
This section focuses on technical issues such as obtaining and using the license key files. For detailed commercial
conditions please <a href="http://www.visagetechnologies.com/contact/" target="New">contact Visage Technologies</a>.</br></br>

</p>

<p>Applications developed using visage|SDK must be licensed in order to function. Licensing is based on License Key Files. A single License Key File is valid for one or more installations on one or more platforms (operating systems). The License Key File can be opened in a text editor in order to read the licensing information, but it is important not to change the file in any way as it would become invalid.</p>


<p>Applications without a valid license key will still function, but tracking time shall be limited to one minute and appropriate
warning messages shall be displayed.</p>

<h2>Obtaining the License Key File</h2>

<p>For 30-day evaluation, simply send an email request to your Visage Technologies contact person and you will receive a License Key File by email.</p>


<h2><a class="anchor" id="include_license"></a>Including the License Key File in your application</h2>

<p>Add License Key File to the Resource group of your app project. In your application, you need to call the initialization
function in order to let the Application read the License Key File. This is done as follows in your application code:
<pre>
	// neccessary prototype declaration for licensing
	namespace VisageSDK {
		void initializeLicenseManager(char *licenseKeyFileName);
	}
	
	//...
	
	//initialize licensing
	initializeLicenseManager("name-of-the-license-file.vlc");

</pre>

where "name-of-the-license-file.vlc" is the name of your License Key File. The above example expects the License Key
File to be in the same place as the executable file.
</p>

<p>
In the Sample projects the licensing code is already inserted, so you just need to change the license key file name when you obtain the license key file. Specifically:<br/>
<br/>
In the Visage Tracker Demo sample project, the licensing code is found in the <i>main</i> method, in the <i>SimpleTracker.cpp</i> file.<br/>
<br/>
In the Visage Detector Demoo sample project, the licensing code is found in the in <i>initDetector</i> method, in the <i>VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper.mm</i> file.
