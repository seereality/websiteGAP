SUMMARY

This introductory section summarizes the main conditions of the License Agreement with the sole 
purpose to enable easier reading. In case of ambiguity other sections prevail.

Visage Technologies grants the Licensee the right to install this computer software on one 
computer and use it internally. Materials produced using the software, such as images or videos, 
may be distributed.
If the software is specifically designed for making applications, i.e. if it is a "Deployment 
Program", such as visage|SDK, then additional rights are granted in the Deployment Annex 
which is part of this Agreement; specifically:

*	Licensee may create software applications using the licensed software.
* 	Licensee may distribute one such application.
* 	A License Key File is provided for the purpose of such distribution; it specifies, among others, 
the name of the application, the number of licensed installations of the application and 
(optionally) the number of licensed concurrent users of the application.
* 	The application shall register itself automatically with the Visage Technologies licensing server.

Software licensed under Academic and Evaluation licenses can not be used for commercial 
purposes.

licenses to distribute certain Third Party software. As a condition of those licenses, Visage 
Technologies is required to distribute the software to Licensee subject to specific terms and 
conditions, which may be different from or additional to those contained herein for Visage 
Technologies' Programs. Licensee understands and agrees that acceptance of this Agreement also 
confirms Licensee's acceptance of the applicable provisions for use, including the restrictions on 
use, of such Third Party software. 


7. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM"). This Agreement shall continue until the earlier of (a) 
termination by Visage Technologies or Licensee as provided below, or (b) such time as there are 
no Programs being licensed to Licensee hereunder.

7.1. For Term Licenses: Licensee understands and agrees that each Term License will expire 
automatically immediately after the corresponding period of the term licensed, unless Licensee 
renews its License. Licensee understands that the Programs will stop operating unless Licensee 
renews its License. Licensee understands and agrees that, if Software Maintenance Service has

automatically upon expiration of the License Term.

7.2. For Perpetual Licenses: Licensee shall have the right to use the Programs indefinitely, subject 
to the termination provisions in this Agreement. 


8. TERMINATION. Visage Technologies may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses 
granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any material term of this 
License, including failure to pay any License fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach 
within sixty (60) days of written notification. Visage Technologies may immediately terminate 
upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach the terms

conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all applicable sales, use, excise, value-
added, and other taxes, duties, levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in 
connection with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based on or 
measured by Visage Technologies' income, for which Visage Technologies shall be solely 
responsible.


10. ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement and its rights 
and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the 
written consent of Visage Technologies. In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer of or 
under this Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant provisions shall be binding upon, and inure 
to the benefit of, the successors, executors, heirs, representatives, administrators and assigns of 
the parties hereto. Visage Technologies may charge Licensee an administrative fee for any 
permitted assignment.


11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Programs should not be relied on as the sole basis to 
solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution or implementation could result in 
injury to person or property. If a Program is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's 
own risk and Visage Technologies and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse 
to the extent allowed by law. Visage Technologies' and Visage Technologies' Licensors' liability 
for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other matter in relation to which 
liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or limited. Except as 
aforesaid, (a) any other liability of Visage Technologies and its Licensors (whether in relation to 
breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed the amount paid to Visage 
Technologies under this Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in question, 
for the Program with respect to which the liability in question arises; and (b) Visage Technologies 
and its Licensors shall have no liability for any indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable 
or otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and loss of use of 
any computer hardware or software). Some countries and states do not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not 
apply to Licensee.


12. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. Visage Technologies warrants 
that Visage Technologies, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to grant the 
License rights hereunder. Visage Technologies warrants, for a period of one (1) year from 
delivery or for the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each Program will 
conform in all material respects to the description of such Program's operation in the 
Documentation. In the event that a Program does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive 
remedy and Visage Technologies' sole liability under this warranty shall be the correction or 
workaround by Visage Technologies of major defects within a reasonable time. Should such 
correction or workaround be impractical, Visage Technologies may, at its option, terminate the 
relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid to Visage Technologies for such Program. 
All requests for warranty assistance should be directed to Visage Technologies AB, 
Tegskiftesgatan 291, SE-58334 Linkoping, Sweden.


13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for warranties expressly set forth in Section 
12 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law provides that the particular terms 
implied cannot be excluded by contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software 
Maintenance Services are delivered "as is" and Visage Technologies makes and the Licensee 
receives no additional express or implied warranties. Visage Technologies and its Licensors 
hereby expressly disclaim any and all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or 
nature concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services (including, 
without limitation, any with regard to infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness 
for a particular purpose or Licensee's purpose). Visage Technologies also expressly disclaims any 
warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance. 
Except for the express warranties stated in Section 12 of this Agreement, the Programs, 
Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are provided with all faults, and the entire 
risk of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee. Visage 
Technologies does not warrant that the Programs and Documentation will operate without 
interruption or be error free. Some states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an 
implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee. The warranty in Section 
12 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may also have other rights which vary from 
state to state and country to country. Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs 
and the results obtained therefrom.


14. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be interpreted, enforced and 
construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed in all respects by the laws of Sweden, 
and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Sweden and consent to the 
service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in such 
courts. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive 
and binding and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction. To the extent any governing law, 
treaty, or regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms of this Agreement 
shall be superseded only to the extent necessary by such law, treaty, or regulation. If any 
provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that 
provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible. In either case, the remainder of 
this Agreement shall not be affected. 


15. COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT RIGHTS. Licensee agrees to notify Visage Technologies 
promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with one or more Licenses granted under this 
Agreement, or any failure to comply with any other material term of this Agreement. To confirm 
Licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee agrees to allow 
Visage Technologies to audit Licensee's use of the Programs, and to provide Visage Technologies 
access to Licensee's facilities and computer systems, and cooperation from Licensee's employees 
and consultants, as reasonably requested by Visage Technologies in order to perform such audit, 
all during normal business hours, and after reasonable prior notice from Visage Technologies. The 
audit shall be performed by an independent chartered public accountant appointed by Visage 
Technologies, at Visage Technologies' expense, and reasonably acceptable to the Licensee and 
shall be subject to the signing of a confidentiality agreement to protect the confidentiality of the 
information revealed in the conduct of the audit. If an audit discloses that Licensee has failed to 
comply with one or more Licenses, and such failure to comply could have in part or in whole been 
avoided by Licensee having paid additional License fees to expand the scope of the License or 
Licenses, then Licensee shall promptly pay Visage Technologies such Licensing fees (at Visage 
Technologies' then current rates) and, if such unpaid License fees exceed 5% of the License fees 
paid to Visage Technologies for the applicable Programs during the applicable period during 
which such underpayment occurred, then Licensee shall, in addition to paying the unpaid License 
fees, also reimburse Visage Technologies the full cost of such audit.


16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, and any applicable Annex thereto including any 
documents referenced therein are incorporated herein by reference, and contain the entire 
understanding of the parties and may not be modified or amended except by written instrument, 
executed by authorized representatives of Visage Technologies and Licensee. In the event of any 
conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by Licensee (whether executed 
before or after this Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail.

Visage Technologies AB Software License Agreement - Deployment Annex

This is an Annex to Visage Technologies AB Software License Agreement (the "Agreement"), 
and the terms and conditions of this Annex are incorporated therein. Each capitalized term used 
herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement.


1. PURPOSE. The Visage Technologies AB Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") 
contains restrictions prohibiting Lisensee from modifying, distributing, or providing access to the 
Programs or any program Components, except as expressly provided in this Annex. If the 
Programs licensed under the Agreement are Deployment Programs, then this Annex sets forth the 
Licensee's rights with respect to creating Applications and Derivative Forms, as well as certain 
additional obligations related thereto.

Visage Technologies and its Licensors retain all right, title and interest in its Programs, Program 
Components and Derivative forms of its Programs.


2. NONCOMPETITION. Licensee agrees not to use the Program, Derivative Forms, or Program 
Components to distribute its own or a Third Party's Application, a principal purpose of which, as 
reasonably determined by Visage Technologies, is to perform the same or similar functions as 
Programs licensed by Visage Technologies or which replaces any component of the Programs. 
Licensee shall not otherwise use the Programs to compete with the products or businesses of 
Visage Technologies, including by distributing Libraries, or any form of an entire Program or a 
substantial portion of a Program.


3. DEFINITIONS.

3.1. "Application"  means a software file that Licensee has created by incorporating or linking any 
part of of any Source Code, library file, or other Program Component provided with the Program. 
An Application must contain original code developed by Licensee and must provide substantial 
functionality not contained in, or provided by, the Program Components that are incorporated 
into such Application. If a software file created by Licensee incorporates Program Components, 
but does not meet the requirements of the previous sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as 
defined below). An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if such Object Code 
was not linked to the Application and was a standalone file, would otherwise have been deemed 
a Derivative Form.

3.2. "Application License"  means a license granted by Licensee to its end-users for the 
installation and use of Licensee's Application.

3.3. "Derivative Forms"  means a software file that Licensee has derived from one or more 
Program Components (including without limitation by incorporating, translating or modifying, in 
whole or in part, any Program Component), and which, if modified or copied without Visage 
Technologies' authorization, would constitute a copyright infringement or breach of the 
Agreement. A software file created by Licensee which qualifies as an "Application" under the 
above definition shall not be deemed a Derivative Form.

3.4. "Linked"  means an executable or loadable file created by a compiler or linker program 
combining Object Code module files.

3.5. "Object Code" means the code created by a system compiler from Source Code; also called 
"machine-readable code". Object Code can be Linked with an appropriate linker to resolve 
address references and may be combined with other Object Code for targeted execution on a 
specific processor. Object Code includes "Object Code libraries" and "shared libraries" which are 
groupings of Object Code for specific purposes.

3.6. "Program Component"  means any portion of, or file provided with, a Program.

3.7. "Source Code"  means human-readable program code written in a higher-level language such 
as C, C++, JavaTM or Fortran, which must be translated or compiled into machine-readable 
language before it can be executed by a computer. Source Code also includes header files and 
other human-readable files necessary for a Program to be compiled in the higher-level language.

3.8. "Standalone Application"  means an Application created using programming languages and 
tools other than the Programs, which execute outside the Programs.

Licensee to whom the License Key was issued and the Application for which it was issued.

5.1. Licensee may distribute copies of the License Key File received with this Program, provided 
that they are always distributed as part of the Application and solely for the purpose of allowing 
end-users to run the Licensee's Application.

5.2. Licensee may not modify the License Key File in any way, nor attempt to create a new 
License Key File.


6. APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT. Licensees of Deployment Programs may create
